Overall Sales Growth: 
• The super store has experienced substantial growth in both sales and profit from 2019 to 2020. 
This upward trend is evident in the year-over-year comparison, particularly from August to 
December, where sales and profits saw significant increases. 
Segment Analysis: 
• Consumer Segment Dominance: The Consumer segment, contributing 48% of total sales, is the 
largest and most critical segment. Strategies aimed at enhancing customer experience and 
loyalty in this segment could further boost sales. 
• Corporate and Home Office Segments: The Corporate and Home Office segments also present 
significant opportunities, contributing 33% and 19% respectively. Tailored marketing and sales 
initiatives targeting these segments can capitalize on their potential. 
Regional Sales Insights:

market presence. Further investment in marketing and customer engagement in this region 
could yield higher returns.

sales, while the South (16%) has the potential for growth. Regional-specific strategies could help 
tap into these markets more effectively. 
Payment Modes: 
• COD and Online Payments: Cash on Delivery (43%) and Online payments (35%) are the most 
popular payment modes. Enhancing the convenience and security of these payment methods 
can drive higher conversion rates.

incentivize their usage to balance the payment mode distribution.

suggesting reliability and cost-effectiveness. Maintaining and improving this service can retain 
customer satisfaction. 
• Expanding Fast Delivery Options: While Second Class (0.11M) and First Class (0.08M) shipping 
options are less popular, promoting these faster delivery methods could attract customers 
needing quicker service.

trajectory, emphasizing the importance of maintaining operational efficiency and customer

instance, in Texas, Washington, and Pennsylvania, efforts to understand local preferences and 
competitive positioning can enhance performance.
